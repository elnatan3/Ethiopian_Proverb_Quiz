# Ethiopian_Proverb_Quiz
This is an Ethiopian proverb quiz app that I created using Java

# Installation Instructions
After downloading this reposity, you can run the program on several IDE such as Eclipse. Once you run the program it will display a welcome page asking for 
your full name. Then you will be redirected to the quiz page where the timer will start automatically.

# Usage
This app is very useful for anyone who wants to be tested on Ethiopian Proverbs. This app is also useful for anyone trying to learn these powerful proverbs. They
are usually not used in other parts of the world and are very significant and profound. I grew up listening to them by my parents and other people whenever they are trying to explain something. I felt the need to share it to the rest of the world to know them and to encourage them to research and figure out what they mean.

# Features
There are questions displayed with choices through A to D that you can click on.
There is a timer being displayed on the bottom right of the quiz window.
Whenever you select an option, the correc choice is displayed in blue whereas the rest will show as red. 
The results will be displayed at the end with the percentage calculated for you. 


# Contribution
I got some help building this project by watching the youtube video by 'Bro Code'. Anyone is welcome to push any updates. People are also encouraged to add more proverbs from Ethiopia.
